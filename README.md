## üîç Description

Cub3D is a 3D maze navigation project inspired by the classic game Wolfenstein 3D.
Using raycasting technology, it creates a retro-style first-person experience by transforming 2D map data into a dynamic 3D environment.
Developed in C with the MiniLibX graphics library, the project highlights core principles of computer graphics and game development,
offering a practical exploration of rendering techniques and real-time visual simulation.

## üéÆ Key Features

- **Raycast Rendering Engine**
  Efficient 3D projection from 2D maps using the **DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer)** algorithm.
  
- **GTA-Style Rotating Minimap**
  Dynamic overhead map rotates with player orientation for intuitive navigation.
  Built using Inverse Mapping (Reverse Transformation/Destination-Driven Warping).

- **Interactive Door System**
  Animated doors that open/close with smooth transitions.

- **Fluid Controls**
  WASD movement, mouse/trackpad camera rotation, and real-time minimap rendering.
