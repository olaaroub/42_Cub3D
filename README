## üîç Description
cub3D is a dynamic 3D maze navigation project that brings retro FPS gameplay to life using **raycasting technology**.
Developed in C with the MiniLibX graphics library, it transforms 2D map data into an immersive 3D environment where players explore mazes,
interact with doors, and navigate using a real-time rotating minimap. Originally inspired by Wolfenstein 3D.
This project demonstrates core principles of computer graphics and game development.

## üéÆ Key Features
- **GTA-Style Rotating Minimap**
  Dynamic overhead map rotates with player orientation for intuitive navigation.

- **Interactive Door System**
  Animated doors that open/close with smooth transitions (activated with `Spacebar`).

- **Sprint Motion Effect**
  Hold `Shift` to sprint, complete with FOV changes and motion blur for immersive movement.

- **Raycast Rendering Engine**
  Efficient 3D projection from 2D maps using the **DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer)** algorithm.

- **Fluid Controls**
  WASD movement, mouse/trackpad camera rotation, and real-time minimap rendering.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
**Tested on macOS/Linux**

1. **Clone Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/olaaroub/42_Cub3D.git cub3d && cd cub3D
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - MiniLibX (included) requires:
     gcc

     sudo apt-get install libxext-dev libxrandr-dev libx11-dev libxml2-dev
     sudo apt-get install gcc make xorg libxext-dev libbsd-dev (Debian/Ubuntu)
     ```

3. **Compile**
   ```bash
   make  # Builds mandatory part
   make bonus # For the bonus part
   ```

## üß† Skills Developed
Through this project, I mastered:
- **Raycasting Mathematics**: Converting 2D maps to 3D environments using angle calculations and grid traversal.
- **DDA Algorithm**: Efficiently determining wall intersections for raycasting optimization.
- **Dynamic Animation Systems**: Door states and motion effects managed via frame-based timing.
- **MiniLibX Graphics**: Low-level window/event management and pixel buffer manipulation.
